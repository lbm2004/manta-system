The distributed nature of nervous systems necessitates to record from a large number of sites in order to understand the neural code, whether single cell, LFP, Î¼ECOG, EEG or MEA recordings are considered. High density recordings also optimize the yield of a preparation and minimize the time-investment for the scientist. Currently, data acquisition (DAQ) systems with high channel counts (>100) can be purchased from a limited number of companies at considerable prices, especially for digital systems. These systems are typically closed source and thus prohibit custom extensions or improvements on a lab level.

We have developed a MATLAB-based DAQ system MANTA (MAtlab N-Times Analog) which combines high channel counts (up to 1500 channels), usage of analog or digital headstages, low per channel cost (<$90), feature-rich display & filtering, and a user-friendly interface with the possibility to easily add features. MANTA is licensed under the GPL and free of charge. MANTA has been in daily use in multiple labs for >1 year, recording reliably from 128 channels, and is developing fast to match user needs. It offers many features, such as integrated spike sorting, PSTH and CSD display and fully customizable electrode array geometry (including 3D arrays), some of which are not available in commercial systems. MANTA runs on a typical PC and communicates via TCP/IP and can thus be easily integrated with existing stimulus generation/control systems in a lab at a fraction of the cost of commercial systems.

With modern neuroscience developing rapidly, MANTA provides a flexible platform that can be rapidly adapted to the needs of new analyses and current questions. Being open-source the development of MANTA can outpace commercial solutions in functionality, while maintaining a low price-point.
